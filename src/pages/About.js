      <p>
        Hello! Thank you for checking out myPub! This little application was
        created as a final capstone project for the Perficient Bright Paths
        program which I was lucky enough to be a part of. With this awesome
        opportunity, I am making the career switch from craft-cocktail
        bartending to full-stack web development with a focus on React.js.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am so excited to have a chance to break into the tech industry, but I
        will always have a passion and love for bartending. It has brought me to
        where I am today and that's why I chose to make my capstone project be
        centered around cocktails. I hope you enjoy!
      </p>
